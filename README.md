# 🚗 Route Distance Calculator using OpenRouteService

This Python project calculates road travel distances and durations between various strategic locations such as 
**mines, processing plants, ports**, and **companies** in **Norway and Germany** using the [OpenRouteService API].

## 📌 Project Purpose

This tool helps visualize and analyze logistical routes for graphite and battery-related supply chains in Europe, particularly:

- From **graphite mines to processing plants** (Norway)
- From **plants to nearby ports** (Norway)
- From **German ports to manufacturing companies** (Germany)

It leverages geospatial data and the OpenRouteService Directions API to estimate:

- Driving distance (in kilometers)
- Driving time (in hours)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas** for data handling
- **requests** for API communication
- **API** for routing
